					"Manhaeve emphasized that aesthetics play a crucial role in creating an emotional connection with users. Pleasing colors, adherence to the golden ratio, and brief visual effects were highlighted as key elements. Transforming traditionally disliked elements, such as forms, into visually appealing components can mitigate user aversion.",
					"He also warned against cluttered interfaces, emphasizing the significance of providing a clear overview for users. Additionally, he advised against underlining text that isn't a hyperlink and highlighted the importance of choosing colors that stand out."

				"type": "section",
				"title": "Usability: Key Principles",
				"body": [
					"Manhaeve, in his discussion on usability, highlighted key principles to enhance the overall user experience.",
					"1. **Controls Selection:** Emphasized long-lasting impact, focusing on effectiveness and efficiency. Advocated for proper control selection, error prevention, and intuitive navigation. Discouraged the use of checkboxes to enforce a choice, recommending radio buttons instead. Stressed the importance of clear and explicit labeling on buttons.",
					"2. **Error Prevention:** Acknowledged user errors as design errors. Urged developers to anticipate potential mistakes and design interfaces to minimize errors. Highlighted the significance of using universally understandable date formats and discouraging multitasking.",
					"3. **Error Messages:** Advocated placing error messages where the error occurred. Emphasized the need for clear information on the problem, its cause, and actionable steps for the user.",
					"4. **Navigation:** Stressed the importance of structured navigation based on user knowledge and de facto standards. Advised against ambiguous terms like \"next\" or \"previous,\" recommending explicit labels. Discouraged the use of fly-out menus and suggested alternatives like the Amazon triangle. Highlighted the crucial role of predictable navigation, referencing a checklist with 247 guidelines.",
					"5. **Visual Hierarchy:** Discussed the visual hierarchy, focusing on call-to-action elements and nudging. Highlighted the effectiveness of colors like orange and blue in emphasizing user benefits.",
					"6. **Fitt's Law:** Introduced Fitt's Law, emphasizing the significance of the \"prime pixel\" and \"magic pixel\" in UI design.",
					"7. **Paradox of Choice:** Noted the negative impact of too many choices, leading to user overwhelm. Suggested solutions such as simplifying options, using subheadings, and grouping related products.",
					"8. **Form Design:** Provided best practices for form design, including asking only necessary questions and using clear labels. Emphasized the importance of avoiding lengthy texts and incorporating inline error detection. Highlighted the need for a clear and user-friendly checkout process.",
					"9. **Product Pages:** Advised presenting product dimensions clearly, considering factors like banner blindness and tunnel vision. Recommended e-commerce platforms offer a guest checkout option to prevent user drop-off during account creation."

				"body": [
					"**Is this an event that comes back weekly/yearly? How long did it last?**",
					"This is not an event that comes back weekly or yearly. This event was at Howest and about 2h long.",
					"**Who is the target audience?**",
					"The target audience is mainly for software engineers, but as a student in the AI major, I found it important to know as much information about everything as possible. If I know software engineering structures, this will only do me good. This is an introductory level of UX / UI. And the theory behind it was not discussed super much.",
					"**Who was the speaker? What experience did this person have?**",
					"Hendrik Manhaeve is a consultant at the International Standardization Organization (ISO) and a board member of the ISA Belgian chapter. He has a lot of experience in the field of UX / UI. Hendrik Manhaeve is currently a lecturer at Queaso Services. He has been a consultant at the International Standardization Organization (ISO) since 2019.",
					"**Was this technical?**",
					"This guest lecture was not super technical. Nothing of code shown, only practical way. There were given a lot of examples of what to do and what not to do. He also showed websites that were not good and some that were good in their own way.",
					"**What did you learn?**",
					"UX/UI is very interessting, because as said in the guest lecture, it is not only about the looks of the website, but also about the usability of the website. It is important to have a good balance between the two. I learned that it is important to have a good structure in your website, so that the user can easily find what he is looking for. SEO let's the user find its way to the website and UX/UI let's the user stay on the website.",
					"**Did you ever come into contact with this topic inside the education?**",
					"Not really, we had a small introduction to UX/UI in the first year, where we were forced to write clean code and make it look good. But this was not really a big part of the education. It might also be because I'm in an AI major and not in a software engineering major.",
					"**Would you recommend this to other students?**",
					"I would recommend this to other students, because it is important to know the basics of UX/UI. Not every developer needs to know the ins and outs of UX/UI, but it is important to know the basics. This guest lecture was very interesting and I learned a lot from it."
