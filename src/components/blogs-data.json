Integrating directly into development tools, workflows, and automation pipelines, Snyk makes it easy for teams to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code. Supported by industry-leading application and security intelligence, Snyk puts security expertise in any developer's toolkit."

				"body": [
					"Amazon has done a study and found out that implementing AI in your development boosts your productivity by 55%. This is a lot and it's very interesting to see how AI can help you in your development. AI can help you with code completion, code generation, code review, code analysis, ... But this also tells us that a lot of developers are using AI in their development. This means that there is a lot of AI-generated code out there. Large Language Models (LLM) hallucinate sometimes. This means that they invent answers that they are 100% sure of that don't make sense. More AI-generated code means more vulnerabilities in the code. This is where Snyk comes in. Snyk can help you find vulnerabilities in your code and fix them."

				"title": "Using AI to make a CoffeShop application (Interactive Demo)",
				"body": [
					"Simon Maple and Sonya Patch created a CoffeShop application, but it needed some new features. Simon firstly created a homepage to show all the items on the menu. This went pretty fast and also without any problems. The second feature was to search for specific words inside this menu. Simon again generated code using co-pilot and it worked, but the code was very unsecure. The code generated allowed SQLInjection. When Simon pushed his code to Github the security part of Snyk interrupted the push and told Simon that there was a vulnerability in his code. Simon was able to fix this vulnerability by using prepared statements. With the third feature, Simon created a way to upload your own picture to your profile, again with generated AI code, and again with a vulnerability. This time it was a problem with path traversal. Lastly, a feature was created to show for each item their own specific page, this again with the help of co-pilot. This code was also unsecure, because it allowed XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).",
					"**What is SQLInjection?**",
					"SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).",
					"**What is Path Traversal?**",
					"Path traversal is a vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. It should be noted that access to files is limited by system operational access control (such as in the case of locked or in-use files on the Microsoft Windows operating system).",
					"**What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?**",
					"Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy."

					"**What did you learn?**",
					"I've learned that you should be careful with AI in your development. AI can help you a lot, but it can also create vulnerabilities in your code. It is important to use a tool like Snyk to find these vulnerabilities and fix them. But these kinds of vulnerabilities are easily found with the right education, so beginner developers and students should be careful (or use AI as little as possible) with using AI in their development.",
					"**Did you ever come into contact with this topic inside the education?**",
					"We've learned about XXS, SQLInjection and Path Traversal in the second year of our education, but this was before ChatGPT or co-pilot was created/used in school. So, we're lucky that we were prepared on these topics before the creation of these tools that can generate vulnerabilities in your code without even knowing it.",
					"**Would you recommend this to other students?**",
