## Introduction

Adam Juran, a software developer since 1998, will tell us about RedwoodJS, a full-stack framework for building and deploying web applications. He also created a simple blog demo using mostly his CLI (command line interface). Let's delve into the key takeaways from his talk.

## RedwoodJS: The Basics

RedwoodJS, a dynamic JavaScript framework, revolutionizes web development. Unlike libraries, frameworks like Redwood offer pre-built tools and best practices for rapid application creation. RedwoodJS, a full-stack framework, comes out-of-the-box with React, GraphQL, Prisma, TypeScript, Jest, and Storybook.

## RedwoodJS: Blog Posts Demo

In a captivating demo, Mr. Juran showcased RedwoodJS's prowess by swiftly building a functional blog site. The CLI's efficiency in creating endpoints highlighted the framework's power, providing a seamless experience for developers to focus on business logic. RedwoodJS emerges as a game-changer, simplifying and accelerating web app development.

He showed how powerful the CLI (command line interface) is when creating any app. When the application ran, the homepage of the application was a list of all endpoints that RedwoodJS created in just a few commands. He actually created a working blog web app that allows user to create posts and being able to display these posts.

## General Information about the guest lesson

### Is this an event that comes back weekly/yearly? How long did it last?

This is not an event that comes back weekly or yearly. This event was at Howest and about 1h long.

### Who is the target audience?

The target audience is software developers that have a little bit of background in software development. RedwoodJS is a full-stack framework that comes with a lot of technologies out of the box. There is a learning curve, but that doesn't last.

### Who was the speaker? What experience did this person have?

Adam Juran has been 'building stuff on the web' since 1998. He's a self-taught developer with 25 years of experience as an internet consultant and founded Juranosaurus Techs in 2021.

### Was this technical?

There was a bit of information about RedwoodJS and it's content, but then Mr. Juran created a simple blog post app and it became a more technical. I liked this part, because it actually shows RedwoodJS in action.

### What did you learn?

I've learned a lot. I haven't heard of RedwoodJS before this event. RedwoodJS let's you use the CLI a lot and it generates code automatically with just a few commands.

### Did you ever come into contact with this topic inside the education?

I haven't heard of RedwoodJS yet, but we've worked with Laravel, a full stack framework, in Howest. The difference here is that RedwoodJS uses new technology, such as React, Prisma, ... Laravel doesn't.

### Would you recommend this to other students?

I would recommend learning about Flutter to any software developer, but this is not very useful for AI developers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, RedwoodJS emerges as a powerful framework for web development, streamlining the process and accelerating the creation of dynamic applications. With its CLI and pre-built tools, RedwoodJS offers a seamless experience for developers to focus on business logic, rather than boilerplate code. RedwoodJS is a game-changer, and I look forward to exploring it further.
