## Introduction

For the course **Professional Networking** the students of Howest needed to organize a PR event. Victor Barra, another student at Howest, and I organized a podcast with my mentor Pieter Coussement. The podcast was about AI and Bio and how they can be combined. This podcast was very interesting and I would like to share the key takeaways from this podcast.
