## Introduction

Simon Maple (Head of AI advocacy) and Sonya Patch (Senior Security Advocate) created together a presentation about AI-Generated code and how to exploit it. They used ChatGPT and Co-Pilot to generate code and by the help of Snyk, they were able to find vulnerabilities in the code. This webinar was about 1h long and was very interesting to watch. Let's delve into the key takeaways from his talk.

## What is Snyk?

Snyk is a developer security platform. Integrating directly into development tools, workflows, and automation pipelines, Snyk makes it easy for teams to find, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code. Supported by industry-leading application and security intelligence, Snyk puts security expertise in any developer's toolkit.

## Why would this be interesting for developers?

Amazon has done a study and found out that implementing AI in your development boosts your productivity by 55%. This is a lot and it's very interesting to see how AI can help you in your development. AI can help you with code completion, code generation, code review, code analysis, ... But this also tells us that a lot of developers are using AI in their development. This means that there is a lot of AI-generated code out there. Large Language Models (LLM) hallucinate sometimes. This means that they invent answers that they are 100% sure of that don't make sense. More AI-generated code means more vulnerabilities in the code. This is where Snyk comes in. Snyk can help you find vulnerabilities in your code and fix them.

## Using AI to make a CoffeShop application (Interactive Demo)

Simon Maple and Sonya Patch created a CoffeShop application, but it needed some new features. Simon firstly created a homepage to show all the items on the menu. This went pretty fast and also without any problems. The second feature was to search for specific words inside this menu. Simon again generated code using co-pilot and it worked, but the code was very unsecure. The code generated allowed SQLInjection. When Simon pushed his code to Github the security part of Snyk interrupted the push and told Simon that there was a vulnerability in his code. Simon was able to fix this vulnerability by using prepared statements. With the third feature, Simon created a way to upload your own picture to your profile, again with generated AI code, and again with a vulnerability. This time it was a problem with path traversal. Lastly, a feature was created to show for each item their own specific page, this again with the help of co-pilot. This code was also unsecure, because it allowed XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

### What is SQLInjection?

SQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).

### What is Path Traversal?

Path traversal is a vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. It should be noted that access to files is limited by system operational access control (such as in the case of locked or in-use files on the Microsoft Windows operating system).

### What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.

## General Information about the guest lesson

### Is this an event that comes back weekly/yearly? How long did it last?

This is not an event that comes back weekly or yearly. This event was an online event hosted by Snyk that lasted 1h.

### Who is the target audience?

The target audience where developers who are interested in AI and how to use it in their development. This is also interesting for developers that are interested in security and how to find vulnerabilities in their code. This event was in general for everyone that has/will use AI to generate their code.

### Who was the speaker? What experience did this person have?

Simon Maple (Head of AI advocacy) and Sonya Patch (Senior Security Advocate). They both work at Snyk and have a lot of experience in the field of security.

### Was this technical?

This was technical, as it showed how to use Snyk and how to find vulnerabilities in your code together with an interactive demo in Java. This wasn't that technical to someone with experience in Java, AI and a little knowledge about security.

### What did you learn?

I've learned that you should be careful with AI in your development. AI can help you a lot, but it can also create vulnerabilities in your code. It is important to use a tool like Snyk to find these vulnerabilities and fix them. But these kinds of vulnerabilities are easily found with the right education, so beginner developers and students should be careful (or use AI as little as possible) with using AI in their development.

### Did you ever come into contact with this topic inside the education?

We've learned about XXS, SQLInjection and Path Traversal in the second year of our education, but this was before ChatGPT or co-pilot was created/used in school. So, we're lucky that we were prepared on these topics before the creation of these tools that can generate vulnerabilities in your code without even knowing it.

### Would you recommend this to other students?

I would recommend this to other students, because it is important to know the basics of security. I would definitely recommend this to students that are interested in using AI tools in their development, because it is good to know that these tools can create vulnerabilities in your code.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Simon Maple and Sonya Patch's insights provide a comprehensive guide to show us how AI-generated code can be exploited. By focusing on the vulnerabilities that AI-generated code can create. It is good to use AI-generated code, because it can boost your productivity, however it is important to know that AI-generated code can create vulnerabilities in your code. By using a tool like Snyk, you can find these vulnerabilities and fix them.
