## Introduction

Dr. Nigam Shah, professor in medicine by medical informatics at Stanford University, associate CIO for data science at Stanford Healthcare and a member of biomedical informatics graduate program as well as a clinical informatics fellowship, created a presentation about how AI can improve healthcare. This webinar was about 1h long and was very interesting to watch. Let's delve into the key takeaways from his talk.

## AI in Healthcare

"We might have a good model, but if we don't have the capacity to follow up on its decision, we might not get any use out of it".

This statement was made by Dr.Shah. This basically means that "If you don't know how it works, why is works, what it does and what it doesn't do, then you can't use it". This is very important in the medical sector, because you can't just use a model that you don't know how it works on patients.

He also stated that there are a lot of medicines that operate this way. We know that they work, but we don't know how they work. This is a very important thing to understand when dealing with AI in the medical sector.

## How do we make sure healthcare AI is fair?

Dr. Shah brings up two very valid questions:
The first question that was notable was:

### Does the model give recommendations that is equally good or equally bad for everyone?

It can't just give different results, just because the skin color/sex/age of someone changes, unless it is supposed to.

Expandability, Transparency and Casual Interpretability are key factors to make an AI model reliable in the medical sense.

Dr. Shah gave an example: "The model concludes that bald men or men with white hair have a higher risk of getting a heart attack." From a engineering standpoint, we can show the weights from the model and see why the model thinks that. From casual interpretation, we know that as men age, they tend to have white hair or be bald, but this doesn't mean that being bald increases the risk to having a heart attack.

A question that came from the audience was:

### How would you deal with missing data in a medical sense?

The answer to this question Dr. Shah gave was very logical. When the missing data is small (~ <=10%), then the data can be imputed using other patients data. There are algorithms that can impute missing data such as using the mean. Dr. Shah then presented the types of missing data. Either the missing data is missing, because it was supposed to be present and it's not or the missing data wasn't useful/needed and therefore not collected.

In a medical sense, just because something is not present, doesn't mean that it is supposed to be present or that you should just impute the data. This is a very important thing to understand when dealing with medical data/real patients when creating an AI model.

## General Information about the guest lesson

### Is this an event that comes back weekly/yearly? How long did it last?

This is not a weekly or yearly event. This webinar lasted about 1h.

### Who is the target audience?

The target audience were people in the fields of STEM more specifically biology, healthcare, AI, science and much more. This webinar was hosted by Stanford.

### Who was the speaker? What experience did this person have?

The speaker, Dr. Nigam Shah, is professor in medicine by medical informatics at Stanford University, associate CIO for data science at Stanford Healthcare and a member of biomedical informatics graduate program as well as a clinical informatics fellowship.

### Was this technical?

For someone who doesn't now a lot about machine learning, this would be a bit too technical, because there are a lot of specific terms and reasons used that other people can't understand. Being a student that is very interested and currently studying AI, this is not that technical.

### What did you learn?

There is no universal way to make an AI model for every sector. In the medical sector there are a lot of question you will need to pose, before creating a model that might be used on patients.

### Did you ever come into contact with this topic inside the education?

We've learned about the basics/advanced topics about AI. Every topic that was discussed, we've learned in our 2 years of AI.

### Would you recommend this to other students?

I would recommend this to all students studying AI, because this is webinar was very interesting to hear. It was also amazing seeing a person which so many accomplishments speaking about a topic I am interested in.

## Conclusion

This webinar was very interesting to watch. It was very interesting to see how AI can be/is used in the medical sector and how it can improve healthcare. AI in the medical sector is a good thing, it takes the load off of doctors and can help them with their work. But it is also a very dangerous thing, because if the model is not good enough, then it can cause a lot of problems.
