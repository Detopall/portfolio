## Crafting My Portfolio Website

In crafting my portfolio website, I embarked on a dynamic journey using Firebase and React, weaving together a tapestry of skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The canvas of my creation extends beyond mere code, as I sought to streamline and organize vast amounts of information without resorting to a conventional database.

## The Dynamic Duo: Vite and React

To tackle the challenge, I turned to the powerful combo of Vite and React, a contemporary duo that effortlessly brings my vision to life. Vite's versatility shines through, offering support for Vue.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Preact, Lit, Svelte, Solid.js, Qwik, and more. This flexibility made it the standout choice for crafting my digital playground.

## Using a JSON file as a 'Database'?

One of the pivotal aspects of my portfolio lies in the Projects and Blogs sections, where a multitude of entries share common data elements. To maintain elegance in design and efficiency in development, I opted for a JSON file. This not only keeps the codebase clean but also facilitates easy updates and additions, ensuring that my portfolio remains a dynamic reflection of my journey.

The blogs are written in markdown and the files are then converted to HTML using a markdown parser. This allows me to write blogs in markdown and then convert them to HTML, which is then rendered on the website. It's easier than writing everything in json and then converting it to HTML.

## Deploying with Firebase

And when it came to sharing my creation with the world, Firebase took the stage. Its free tier, unlike many others, doesn't demand a credit card upfront, offering a genuinely free experience. This resonated with my ethos, avoiding the potential pitfalls of unexpected charges for breaching usage limits.

## Conclusion

I had a blast crafting my portfolio website, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed creating it! This is still a work in progress, and I look forward to adding more content and features in the future.
