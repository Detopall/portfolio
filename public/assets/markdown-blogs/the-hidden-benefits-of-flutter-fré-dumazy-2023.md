## Introduction

Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit by Google, enabling the creation of natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Its expressive and flexible framework allows developers to craft visually appealing and high-performance apps with a seamless user experience. The speaker of this event, Fré Dumazy, will tell us more about Flutter and why we should use it.

## Flutter: The Basics

Flutter, Google's open-source UI toolkit, relies on the powerful Dart language as its secret sauce. Dart boasts the ability to compile to native code or JavaScript, offering both Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation. This type-safe language provides developers with a rich array of libraries for crafting seamless applications.

## Flutter has Developers In Mind

Designed with developers in mind, Dart introduces a game-changer—stateful hot-reloading. This means that simple UI changes no longer necessitate restarting the entire application, streamlining the development process and enhancing efficiency. Additionally, Dart's rich set of libraries, including the Material Design library, enables developers to create visually appealing applications with ease.

## Open Source: The Power of Collaboration

In the world of Flutter, the possibilities are vast, and the best part? It's all open source, fostering a collaborative environment for innovation and creativity. Explore the magic of Flutter and Dart, where one language unlocks the door to multi-platform app development.

## General Information about the guest lesson

### Is this an event that comes back weekly/yearly? How long did it last?

This is not an event that comes back weekly or yearly. This event was at Howest and about 1h long.

### Who is the target audience?

The target audience is mainly for software engineers, but as a student in the AI major, I found it important to know about Flutter. I'm also interested in Software Development and I would now want to create some Flutter projects.

### Who was the speaker? What experience did this person have?

Fré Dumazy is an app developer since 2012. He's the founder of Skystone Apps, which is an IT Consulancy agency.

### Was this technical?

This might be a bit technical in comparison with someone that doesn't know how to code, but this is not that technical to someone that knows the programming jargon. Fré showed some code which became a bit more technical, because I haven't see Flutter code, yet.

### What did you learn?

I've learned that flutter might actually be a good programming language. Flutter can be used for nearly everything. You don't need to learn Kotlin (Android only), or Swift (iOS) only, you can learn Flutter, because it's multi-platform.

### Did you ever come into contact with this topic inside the education?

We don't have any app development in the AI group, but I've heard about Flutter when studying software development on my own time.

### Would you recommend this to other students?

I would recommend learning about Flutter to any software developer, but this is not very useful for AI developers.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the exploration of Flutter and Dart revealed a dynamic duo for versatile app development. Fré Dumazy's insightful session showcased the power of Flutter's open-source framework and Dart's efficiency. For aspiring developers, it's a gateway to multi-platform mastery, making it a worthwhile addition to any coding repertoire.
