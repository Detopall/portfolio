## Introduction

Decentralized Autonomous Hackathon (DAH) is a hackathon organized by Howest. This hackathon is about creating a decentralized application using blockchain and AI. Spending 24h on creating a decentralized application is a challenge, but it is also a lot of fun. This hackathon is a great opportunity to learn more about blockchain and AI and to meet new people. Let's delve into the key takeaways from this hackathon.

Bart Coelus was the coach/presentor/mentor during this hackathon.

## What is a Decentralized Application (DApp)?

A decentralized application (DApp) is a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system. DApps have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as the Ethereum Blockchain, where DApps are often referred to as smart contracts.

## Sportify

Sportify was the name of our project. Sportify is a decentralized application that allows you to participate on a new quiz each day. The quiz is about sports and you can win a special NFT (Non-Fungible Token) when completing all the quizzes.

## Video

We created a walkthrough video of our project. You can watch the video here

### Features

You can login with your Metamask wallet and start the quiz. The quiz consists of 3 different Formula 1 courses that you had to draw on a canvas. These drawing were then analyzed by a self-trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to see if you drew the correct course. When you completed the quiz, you could see your score and the correct answers.

There was also a chatbot where you could ask questions about Formula 1 in very specific ways. The chatbot was created using a RAG framework.

The NFT that you could win was a Formula 1 car. The NFT can be used as a certificate of completion for completing all the quizzes. It can be found here: [Sportify NFT](https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/amoy/0xe8e9e68a61570ff81296543509722e2c5514025c/1)

Users could also use see a leaderboard with the top players. The leaderboard was updated in real-time, so you could see your position on the leaderboard.

### What is a RAG framework?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with retrieval techniques to improve the quality and accuracy of generated responses. It allows LLMs to access up-to-date and relevant information from external sources, overcoming their limitations in terms of stale, incomplete, or inaccurate knowledge.

RAG consists of three main components: an LLM, a data source, and a vector database. The LLM is a pretrained model responsible for text generation, while the data source can be any collection of documents or facts relevant to the task or domain. The vector database stores vectors and graphs, allowing efficient retrieval of relevant information based on the user's query.

Our chatbot used the RAG framework to answer questions about Formula 1. The chatbot was able to answer questions using GPT-3.5 Turbo.

### What is a Non-Fungible Token (NFT)?

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files.

## Results

We didn't win, but we had a lot of fun creating Sportify. We learned a lot about blockchain and AI and we met a lot of new people. We also learned a lot about the RAG framework and how to use it in a chatbot. Creating an NFT and working with blockchain was new to me, but very interesting.

## Conclusion

Participating in the Decentralized Autonomous Hackathon (DAH) organized by Howest was a rewarding experience. Developing Sportify, a decentralized application integrating blockchain and AI, allowed us to explore the innovative intersection of technology. Through Sportify, we engaged with the concepts of DApps, NFTs, and the practical application of AI frameworks like RAG.

Despite not clinching the top spot, the journey of creating Sportify was filled with learning opportunities, collaboration, and the thrill of pushing boundaries within a 24-hour timeframe. The hackathon not only expanded our knowledge of blockchain and AI but also provided a platform to connect with like-minded individuals and showcase our creativity.

Looking ahead, the experience gained from DAH fuels our enthusiasm for future hackathons, where we aim to continue honing our skills, fostering innovation, and embracing the dynamic world of decentralized applications.
