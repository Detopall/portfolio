## Introduction

The curtains have closed on the exhilarating Social Data Science Student Hackathon 2023, leaving behind a trail of creativity, determination, and data-driven insights. Márton Pósfai, Petra Kralj Novak and Thomas Robiglio were the speakers and judges of this event organized by the Central European University. This hackathon brought together aspiring data scientists including every continent except Antarctica and Oceania, all eager to tackle the complex issue of food insecurity in Yemen.

## Setting the Stage: Challenges and Ambitions

From the opening session on Friday night (17h), the participants, including our very own "Turing Titans", which consists of classmates from Howest: Victor Barra, Gaétan Vandenberge, and yours truly, were immersed in the challenges that lay ahead. The dataset, shrouded in mystery until the kickoff, revolved around the multifaceted factors contributing to food insecurity—ranging from rainfall patterns to conflict dynamics.

The organizers also told us that there was a total prize money of €1600. This was split in these categories:

Infographic:

- €400 for the best BA student
- €200 for the second best BA student
- €200 for the best highschool student

Prediction:

- €400 for the best BA student
- €200 for the second best BA student
- €200 for the best highschool student

## The Challenges

There were two challenges to choose from, each with a unique focus. The first challenge was to create an infographic, highlighting patterns in the dataset with a focus on social inequalities. The second challenge was to build a predictive model, aiming to decipher food insecurity complexities through algorithms. We chose to do both, because we are ambitious and we wanted to learn as much as possible.

### Challenge 1: Prediction

Venturing into machine learning, the team explored predictive analytics, aiming to decipher food insecurity complexities through algorithms, despite the ticking clock.

We started with the Prediction challenge. This had to be the easy one, because we've learned about AI model and how to build them, so it couldn't have been that hard. We were wrong. The data wasn't optimal. We didn't know what we were doing and by the end of the second day, the Turning Titans were stuck.

### Challenge 2: Infographic

We didn't want to give up and we've made a lot of progress using the different dataset and combining it into one. We've decided to start with the infographic challenge. We've learned about data visualization a bit, but not how to make an infographic. The Turning Titans thought that it was just like writing a paper, but with pictures. We were wrong, again. We've decides to just hand in the infographic and not the prediction, because we didn't want to hand in something that wasn't finished.

## The Verdict

Winners were announced on Monday evening, recognizing creativity, clarity of presentation, and predictive performance. The "Turing Titans" didn't win, but we've learned a lot and will be better prepared for the next hackathon.

## Reflecting on the Experience

Márton Pósfai said something on Monday, while talking about giving away prizes, that really stuck with me. He said that most of the students got stuck or wasted a lot of time on the features and the underlining theory of AI model. He said that we should have just started with **"a"** prediction model that was simple and returned the right kind of data. We could have then build on that and made it more complex. This is something that I will remember for the next years to come.

## General Information about the hackathon

### Is this an event that comes back weekly/yearly? How long did it last?

This hackathon was a yearly event. It usually lasts 3 days.

### Who is the target audience?

The target audience was mainly for students of data scientists. But also for high school students that are interested in data science.

### Who was the speaker? What experience did this person have?

The speakers were Márton Pósfai, Petra Kralj Novak and Thomas Robiglio. They are all professors at the Central European University. They all have a lot of experience in the field of data science.

### Was this technical?

It was a hackathon, so it was technical. But it was also a competition, so it was also about the best idea and the best presentation.

### What did you learn?

Not to rush into things. We should have started with a simple model and then build on that. We wasted a lot of time on the underlining theory of AI model and the features. We could've also just looked up what an infographic is and how to make one and we would've had a better chance of winning.

### Did you ever come into contact with this topic inside the education?

Yes. We're (at the time of writing this) studying for our Bachlor's degree in Applied Computer Science (with a major in AI). We've learned about AI models and how to build them. We've also learned about data visualization.

### Would you recommend this to other students?

I would recommend this to other students in the field of data science. It is a great way to learn about data science and to learn how to work under pressure. It was the first time that I've participated in a hackathon and I've learned a lot from it.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Social Data Science Student Hackathon 2023 was a great experience. We've learned a lot and we will be better prepared for the next hackathon.
